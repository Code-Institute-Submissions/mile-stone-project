facebook, instagram or youtube web-pages and will be added Albums flicking over on the right hand site of the page.



### Testing

The Monkees website was created to give their fans more informations and interaction with them.
When they get in the first page it will able to read a short description of the band,
information about that social media is coming soon, and that they can be contacted to play in partys, proms and weddings as well, it 
was provided a photo of the band under them to show people they are in the right website and this is The Monkees rock band.
They can find in the footer of the page live updates from tours and shows, but, will be able to desktop and tablets versions due to 
make the site more responsive. On the left hand side they can see the future links to social media displayed as icons from facebook,
instagram and youtube. On the right hand side you can find Albumns that is not a link where the idea is to flick them over, that will
be implemented in the future as the developer is using only what he got as assets. On top of they can see the navbar where they can 
accsess Photos, Videos, Musics and Contact the band. The Monkees link on the title it's also a link to go back to main(first-page) whem 
they go in another part of the site as photos for exemple.

By clicking on navbar Photos the user can have accsess to all selected range of The Monkees photos, if they want to see their videos then they should
click on navbar video-clip to open all videos provided, videos were iframed from youtube due a problem when loaded from assets. When the user wants to listen
some The Monkees music they can click on navbar music and there will be all The Monkees music. To contact the band for concerts, weddings, proms, partys the
user should click on navbar Contac Us and will be displayed phone number, old style not much used in these days fax number and a place to email them with 
full-name, e-mail and text-area where all campus are required.

As a front-end project based on HTML and CSS only will be impossible to send an e-mail or give them a phone call and send them a fax.
